## The Business Value of User Research

It essentially means the difference between getting it right from the start or having to go back and fix your mistakes.

### Field study

- exactly how users do something and why so
- user needs and discover opportunities for their satisfaction

### In-depth interview

- user scenarios
- user goals, tasks and problems
- motivation to use products

### Diary study

- patterns and scenarios of interaction with the product

---

### Card Sorting

### Eye tracking

- where the user’s eye has focused
- the sequence of passing through the various elements
- zones in which a person doesn’t look at all
